# Modeling of Complex Systems
In this gitHub, the different codes created for the course CSYS302 will be uploaded, creating folders for each one of the assignments. MATLAB will be the programming language to create the functions and the scripts.

## Homework 1 - Fractals & L-systems

### Part A
There are two functions inside this folder: one that expands the L-system from the axiom applying a set of rules and another one that draws the string obtained from that expansion (using turtle graphics). Both functions are called from a script that compute and draw different L-systems.

### Part B
